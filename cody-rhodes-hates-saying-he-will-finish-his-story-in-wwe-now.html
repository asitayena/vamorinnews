The American Nightmare is still working had to finish his story, but he has to admit now that he really doesn’t like that idea at this point.</p><p>In the buildup to his showdown against Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 39, Cody Rhodes introduced a powerful catchphrase, “finish the story.” This phrase held significant meaning, as it symbolized Rhodes’ family’s long-standing struggle to capture the elusive WWE Championship, fueling fans’ hopes that he would finally dethrone The Tribal Chief.</p><p>The excitement reached its peak inside the grand SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, where Rhodes came agonizingly close to achieving his dream, only to be thwarted by the interference of Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa. Needless to say, WrestleMania 39 didn’t turn out how he wanted it to. Since that moment, Cody Rhodes has been fixated on settling matters with Brock Lesnar, and they have a third match slated against each other at SummerSlam.</p><p>What was once an inspiring rallying cry has now taken an unexpected turn, transforming into a recurring meme on social media. During an interview with <a href=#>Sam Roberts</a>, Cody Rhodes candidly revealed that the catchphrase, “finish the story,” has become something of an albatross for him, eliciting mixed emotions as it strays from its original intent. Despite the unintended outcome, Rhodes remains determined to forge his path and prove his worth in the ever-competitive world of wrestling.</p><p>“I think likely the reason now is the best time is the WWE audience, the WWE Universe, pro wrestling fans, all these fandoms, sometimes the pockets are different, the circles are different. There’s not as much crossover as we think. Like, you’re a longtime fan. You can tell me about the Mega Powers and you can tell me about Bash at the Beach and you can walk me through that. There’s a lot of fans who come to the shows today, there’s actually a lot of people in the locker room who are on the shows today, who might not know about any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s why I think now is the perfect time from the perspective of WWE because it really does inform everybody as to what all took place. They think they might know the journey. Oh, he came back in Dallas and Corey Graves said from undesirable to undeniable and the prodigal son and all that awesome stuff that Graves put on it, the soundtrack essentially to the return, but what I love about the documentary is it’s the full story. Remember, we’re talking about finishing the story, which I now hate saying. If you want to know the story we’re talking about, it’s in this documentary.”</p><p>Only time will tell how Cody Rhodes is booked at WrestleMania 40 in Philly. It seems that he could be on his way to another big match. It would be interesting to see how WWE books things for Rhodes as he continues his story, in whichever direction he goes.</p><p>For more on this story, and so many more, please check back with us here at Ringside News. After all, things are only getting more interesting as things continue, and he is still going with a full head of steam.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with Cody Rhodes in WWE?
