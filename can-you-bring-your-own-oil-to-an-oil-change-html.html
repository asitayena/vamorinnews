They may even charge you less for the oil change since they will often deduct the cost of the bulk oil that would normally be placed in your vehicle from the bill while doing the service.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it possible to bring your own oil to Walmart in this manner?</h3><p>For the sake of answering the OP’s query, Walmart often provides Pennzoil w/OCOD as their “house brand.” They do provide an oil change service for which they charge a fixed cost and you are responsible for bringing your own oil and filter. Bring in a competitor’s coupon and they will match it, if you want to truly put them on the spot.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In the same vein, how much money do you save by doing your own oil change?</h3><p>&nbsp;Get your oil changed twice a year (the average number of miles driven in the United States each year is 15,000, according to AAA). It takes 20 minutes to do an average outsourced oil change for $30. (experience) Your time is worth $8.00 per hour spent waiting at the oil change location since you may use that time to accomplish other useful things (as opposed to $10).</p><p></p><h3>Furthermore, is it possible for me to bring my own oil to Midas?</h3><p>You should always carry your own oil, filter, and oil filter gasket when visiting a business such as Midas. They make their purchases by the drum. You will be fortunate if you are able to put the proper amount of oil in your automobile (although 5W30 if pretty common for most cars these days).</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible for me to bring my own oil and filter to Firestone?</h3><p>A word of caution: If you decide to replace the oil in your automobile on your own, be sure you properly dispose of the spent oil and filter. It is possible to drop off both items at your local Firestone Complete Auto Care shop, or you may search for a hazardous waste recycling centre near you on Earth911.com.</p><p></p><h3>There were 39 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>Who manufactures the synthetic oil that Walmart uses?</h3><p>Mobil 1 Advanced Full Synthetic Motor Oil 0W-40, 5 qt.

Shop local Groupon deals. Military, first responder, or over 55? Watch for perks at Car Wash + Lube Centers. Change the oil yourself.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How much does it cost to have your oil changed at Walmart?</h3><p>So how much does an oil change cost at Walmart? Walmart Basic Oil Change Prices start from $29.88 and increase depending on the oil change type.</p><p></p><h3>Does Jiffy Lube have Dexos oil?</h3><p>Using a motor oil that does not meet dexos specifications can void your warranty, even if you use it just once. So, for obvious reasons, Jiffy Lube strongly encourages customers with 2011 and newer GM vehicles to use an oil that meets dexos specifications.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How much does Walmart charge for an oil change?</h3><p>The Walmart oil change cost for the highest level oil change is $50.00 and each oil change based on a vehicle requiring five quarts of oil.

Synthetic oil is more expensive than conventional oil but offers superior protection for your car’s engine. Synthetic oil provides more effective protection for your car, may even prolong the life of your engine and would cost the average driver just $65 more each year.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Does Midas do good oil changes?</h3><p>Imo, if you use conventional oil, places like midas are a good deal. Those oil drums are a value. However, if your run full synthetic, which I recommend, Midas can get expensive. Many of them add extra “disposal” fees, charge extra for the filter, charge a LOT more if you need extra oil, etc</p><p></p><h3>What does Midas oil change include?</h3><p>What’s included: Up to 5 quarts of oil and a standard oil filter. Midas Touch courtesy check of the battery, engine air filter, belts and hoses, coolant, and various fluids upon request.</p><p></p><h3>How much does Midas charge for a synthetic oil change?</h3><p>Based on national averages before discounts, the price range for a full synthetic oil change is $45-$75, while a synthetic blend oil change costs $32-$53.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6cmKdlqaTCbq7RoqWgZamkwrN5zrClZqeZoXq1u4yapWanmaF6pLTAp56eZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carrie-rad-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carrie Rad , Wikipedia, Biography Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more">&larr;
