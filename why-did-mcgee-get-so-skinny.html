Many fans believe he might be sick, but that's not the truth; he had a weight loss of 25 pounds in 2010 due to diet. He did gain some weight back, but he hasn't stopped himself from following a weight loss diet and exercise routine that led to transformation.</strong></p><p>Timothy McGee is a character on the CBS television show NCIS, portrayed by <strong>Sean Murray</strong>. He is a Johns Hopkins University and MIT graduate who specializes in cybersecurity and computer crime. The most recent season of the popular show attempted to present a 22-episode string of character-centric episodes, beginning with a small NCIS: Hawai'i crossover that settled the riddle of Parker's supposedly dishonest ex-wife Vivian and ending with a 3-way NCIS universe team-up at halfway.</p><p>After gaining prominence as a youth in Hocus Pocus, John Hopkins the <a href=#><strong>actor</strong></a> has cemented his position in American television history as Special Agent Timothy McGee on NCIS. McGee looks skinny than before and some people were astonished by his weight loss in NCIS season 8, leaving some toto know if McGee is sick;</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <a href=#><strong>weight loss</strong></a> efforts of <a href=#><strong>Corey</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Liz Hayes</strong></a>.</p><h2>After a Weight Loss of 25 Pounds, Timothy McGee Has Remained Skinny!</h2><p>Timothy McGee, played by actor Sean Harland Murray in the popular American television series NCIS, has gone to be skinny. He has been a regular on the iconic CBS program NCIS for over two decades, and he kept facing weight <a href=# rel=noopener>fluctuations</a>.</p><p>This is not the first time McGee has had weight loss; in the past few years, he underwent a transformation. Fans of the actor will recall that he dramatically slimmed down for his second season on the show. The actor first appeared as Timothy in season seven, then stunned viewers with a radically slimmed-down appearance in season eight, generating a barrage of fan queries.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/08/why-did-mcgee-get-so-skinny-1.jpg alt="Timothy McGee, had a weight loss of 25 pounds. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Timothy McGee, had a weight loss of 25 pounds.<br></strong><strong>Source: Pu Eble Rino</strong></p><p>Sean Murray astonished many of his followers by losing <strong>25 pounds</strong> in 2010. He did, however, state that it would be a progressive process, and fans might see his weight decrease during Season 7. He credited his weight loss achievement to a strict diet that excluded alcohol and sugar. And in 2023 also he seems skinny which lead fans to believe he might be sick.</p><p>Sean Murray appears to be doing well in both his personal and professional lives right now, with no obvious concerns regarding his physical or mental health. Fans were initially alarmed when they noted his significant weight loss and suspected it was due to an illness.</p><p>However, McGee's actor Sean Murray is in good health, despite his abrupt weight reduction and skinny appearance, which alarmed his supporters. To stay fit, he followed a proper diet, undergoing weight loss and resulting in a skinny appearance.</p><h2>Timothy McGee Followed a Weight Loss Diet to Remain Healthy, Leading Him to Become Skinny!</h2><p>McGee grew into a distinguished NCIS senior special agent with each season. But it's possible that the most <a href=# rel=noopener>significant shift </a>in his life was not his professional advancement but his physical appearance. Aside from a quip about using the stairs and avoiding doughnuts, not much was said regarding his physical transformation on screen.</p><p>In real life, Murray lost <strong>25 pounds</strong> after making major lifestyle adjustments in order to be healthier. Naturally, this explains why the shift was not addressed in NCIS, as it appears to have been a personal choice made by the actor rather than done to enhance the show's character. NCIS is full of mysteries, but <strong>Sean Murray</strong> put his weight loss enigma to rest with a <a href=# rel=noopener>tweet</a> to his fans <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>;</p><p><strong>To those who have asked what I did to lose the 25 pounds: 14 months of no alcohol and almost no sugar. I only ate organic.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/08/mcgee-weight-loss-diet.jpg alt="Timothy McGee followed an organic diet for his skinny figure and weight loss. celebsindepth.com" width=480 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Timothy McGee followed an organic diet for his skinny figure and weight loss.<br></strong><strong>Source: Nicki Swift</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>This diet worked well, so much so that some NCIS watchers were concerned Sean was ill. Many viewers commended Sean for his stunning change after he explained that his weight loss was due to eating healthily. To keep up with the hard production schedule of NCIS, Sean Harland Murray, the acclaimed American actor, had to maintain a physically fit body.</p><p>To accomplish this, he began running and going to the gym on a daily basis.

In addition, he made substantial dietary modifications, choosing healthier foods that aided in weight loss and enhanced energy levels. He not only met his weight loss goals, but he also emphasized his entire health and well-being as a result of these lifestyle adjustments.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>McGee's weight-loss journey motivated many of his supporters to choose a healthier lifestyle.
