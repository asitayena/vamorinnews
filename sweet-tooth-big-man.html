Big Man tracked to the place where Gus was hiding, and despite his original objective, he ended up Kἰlling the poacher who was after Gus to protect him.</p><p>The epidemic had taken a lot from Big Man, whose real name was Thomas “Tommy” Jeppard, and he was still trying to deal with the loss and sadness he had endured.</p><h2>When Did Big Man’s Family Disappear?</h2><p>Thomas Jeppard was a well-known football player for the Guardians before the H5G9 pandemic. Louisa, his expectant wife, went into labor right as the H5N9 virus was emerging and the situation was rapidly d*teriorating into chaos and mayhem.</p><p>The victims rushed to hospitals in the vain hope that medical professionals could cure whatever ailed them. There was a paucity of staff and the hospitals were flooded. What made matters worse was that, at the time, medical professionals had no idea what kind of virus they were dealing with, thus they had no way to treat it.</p><p>The pandemic had only just begun, but the groundwork for the Last Man Legion had already been established. Despite Big Man’s best efforts, he was unable to find his family after joining Abbot’s army. At one point, Big Man informed his superior that he would refuse to continue working for the company until he was provided with details on his relatives.</p><p><strong>Check out more we have covered about Sweet Tooth season 2 cast and season 3 release date in below links:</strong></p><h2>Will Big Man and Birdie Reunite in Season 3 of ‘Sweet Tooth’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Big-Man.webp><p>Over time, Big Man developed feelings for Gus, something he had avoided doing since the death of his family. Both his own loss and Gus’ endearing actions played significant roles in softening his façade and leading him to accept the tiny guy as a member of his family.</p><p>Big Man had a marking on his br*ast that let Becky’s animal army know he was one of the Last Men.</p><p>They would have killed him if Gus hadn’t firmly taken Big Man’s side and convinced them he wasn’t a horrible guy. Big Man realized that Gus could have simply abandoned him since Becky would have helped him go to Colorado regardless, but Gus stayed and protected him instead.</p><p>Big Man had already lost his family once, and he was determined not to let that happen again. Both Big Man and Gus had lost their families and didn’t have anyone left they could call their own, so Big Man saw a lot of parallels between the two.</p><p>If you wanted to read more latest tv shows and movies then you can join us on our<a href=# rel=noopener> Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdganxxgI6srp6dpGLBsLvToWSboZdiuqK6jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./martin-petit-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Martin Petit Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family">&larr;
