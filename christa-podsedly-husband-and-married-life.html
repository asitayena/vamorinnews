It wasn’t until she wed the WWE superstar that she rose to popularity.</strong></p><p>After several years of marriage, the couple’s relationship is still going strong. What is the cause behind their long-lasting marriage? Do Christa and her spouse Scott have any kids as well?</p><h2><span id=When_did_Christa_Podsedly_and_her_husband_Scott_tie_the_knot>When did Christa Podsedly and her husband Scott tie the knot?</span></h2><p>June 2000 saw the pair exchange vows in a low-key ceremony that was seen by their relatives and close friends. The pair has been married for more than 20 years, and their union is still going strong. The two frequently appear to be spending quality time together in a variety of settings, and they are also very honest about their love lives.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Their_Encounter_Begin>How Did Their Encounter Begin?</span></h2><p>It was at a gym that Christa met Scott, her future husband at the time. She shares her man’s passion for fitness. For a while, the pair continued to be friends. Before walking down the aisle, sources claimed the two dated for a considerable amount of time.</p><h2><span id=Christa_Podsedly_and_her_spouse_have_two_children>Christa Podsedly and her spouse have two children.</span></h2><p>The couple is fortunate to have two adult sons, Brock Rechsteiner and Brandon Rechstiner. August 2002 saw the birth of Brock. They both have a close relationship with their parents.</p><h2><span id=Both_of_Christa8217s_sons_play_sports>Both of Christa’s sons play sports.</span></h2><p>Football players Brock and Brandon attend Etowah High School in Woodstock, Georgia. Brandon, who stands five feet ten inches tall, will graduate from the institution in 2023, while his older brother Brock, who is six feet two inches tall, will do so in 2021.</p><p>So far, they play basketball in addition to football. Their devoted mother Christa frequently brags on her sons’ sporting achievements on social media.</p><h2><span id=Is_Bohannon_Braden_The_son_of_Scott_Steiner_too>Is Bohannon Braden? The son of Scott Steiner, too?</span></h2><p>In August 2020, Brock’s brother Brandon posted a couple pictures of the two of them celebrating Brock’s 18th birthday. In the picture, Braden added, “My step bros right there.”</p><p>Therefore, even though Scott and Christa haven’t spoken about Bohannon yet, it is obvious that he is their kid from a previous relationship.</p><p>Braden attends Elco High School and plays basketball and football, just like his stepbrothers. Bohannon, who stands 5 feet 11 inches tall, plays safety and quarterback in football.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Christa_Podsedly_the_Wife_of_Scott_Steiner>Who Is Christa Podsedly, the Wife of Scott Steiner?</span></h2><p>Christa is a businesswoman who co-owned the Acworth, Georgia, Shoney’s Kitchen & Bar franchise. Together with her spouse, she opened the eatery in 2016. However, COVID-19 forced the pair to close their firm in 2020.</p><p>On the Facebook page for their eatery, they shared the news.</p><p>“We have had to close our business because of COVID-19.” We are grateful for your support during the previous four years.</p><p>Steiner disclosed that a sports bar will shortly open.</p><h2><span id=Christa_Podsedly_where_are_you_from_The_Death_of_Her_Father_and_Family>Christa Podsedly, where are you from? The Death of Her Father and Family</span></h2><p>Christa Rechsteiner, the spouse of Scott Steiner, was born in New York State. She is the daughter of Susan M. Podsedly, the mother, and David Aloys, the father. Nov. 10, 2011, was her father’s death date. For six months, he had been afflicted with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>David studied at Michigan State University. He worked for about 37 years as an engineer at the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, for the most of his career. The old man retired and moved to Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p><p>Christa is also related to Stephen M. Podsedly, her brother. LeeRoy Rechsteiner is the name of her grandfather.</p><p>Rechsteiner began attending State University of New York College at Cortland in 1993. Her major was Biology/Biological Sciences with a General Minor in Wellness & Health Promotion at the Bachelor of Science level.</p><p>She served as the President of the BACCHUS Network in addition to serving as the Gymnastics Team Captain for three years, from 1994 to 1997.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_of_Christa_Podsedly>What Is The Net Worth of Christa Podsedly?</span></h2><p>As of 2022, some publications claim that her fortune is $200,000. Meanwhile, Scott, the spouse of Podsedly, is thought to be worth $1 million. The majority of his wealth has primarily come from his lucrative career as a professional wrestler.</p><h2><span id=Scott_Steiner_the_famous_husband_of_AD_what_happened_to_him>Scott Steiner, the famous husband of AD, what happened to him?</span></h2><p>Steiner started his wrestling career at the University of Michigan after being born and reared in Michigan. Rick Steiner, his brother, is a professional wrestler as well.</p><p>In 1986, he made his debut in the World Wrestling Association, based in Indianapolis. Steiner has wrestled for a number of organizations over his long career, including World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/WWE), Crockett Promotions (JCP), and others.</p><p>He has held the titles of World Heavyweight Champion in the WWC, World Heavyweight Champion in the WWA, and World Heavyweight Champion in the WCW.</p><p>In addition, Scott had an unexpected falling out in the Atlanta locker room at an Impact Wrestling taping early in 2020. He was flown to a hospital in the area.</p><p>In March, his wife Christa declared on Twitter that he will fully recover. She also thanked everyone who had sent well wishes.</p><p>I wanted to start by expressing my gratitude to @IMPACTWRESTLING, @ScottDAmore, @THETOMMYDREAMER, @johnnyswinger2, @JoeyRyanOnline, @IMPACTWRESTLING, and Cobb County EMTs for their wonderful care of my spouse. We are grateful for all the kind words, prayers, and good wishes. He’s going to become better 💯.</p><p>wrestlers Johnny Swinger, Joey Ryan, and Tommy Dreamer were among others that were admitted to the hospital alongside Scott.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Christa is not on any social media sites, if you were unaware.
