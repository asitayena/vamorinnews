Sinema, along with <strong>Martha McSally</strong>, the junior U.S Senator, has been serving for Arizona since <i>January 2019</i>. Additionally, Kyrsten is the first openly bisexual woman who got elected in the U.S Congress and U.S Senate.</p><p>The Arizona senator was born on <i>July 12, 1976, </i>in Tucson, Arizona. Talking about her education, Sinema has a Master's degree in Social Work from Arizona State University (ASU). She also received a Juris Doctor (J.D) degree from ASU College of Law.

Their relationship couldn't survive, and they divorced each other. Both Sinema and her ex-spouse haven't spilled a bean of information regarding their past marital life.</p><h2>Difficult Childhood</h2><p>Sinema's parents were <strong>Marilyn</strong> (mother) and <strong>Dan Sinema</strong> (father). They divorced when Kyrsten was a child. She has two siblings, a younger sister, and an older brother. Her father was a well-known attorney.</p><p>Sinema's mother remarried, and the family relocated to Florida. There the family faced a tragic situation. Her stepfather lost his job and became unemployed. Afterward, the family lived in a remodeled gas station for three years.</p><p>Later, Kyrsten relocated to Arizona in 1995. She grew up as a member of <i>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>. Initially, she served as a social worker from 1995 to 2002.

Her student loan debts placed her net worth in negative figures. She began working as a senator from her office since January 2019. Therefore, her net worth can be no more than <strong>$150,000</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/23/image-1584954929156.png><p>Although Kyrsten's net worth is not higher, she regularly receives outside earnings, such as donations.

Paul is the first senator to have infected from the virus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/3/29/Sinematweet-1585492187679.jpg><p>Rand faced extensive criticism for not staying under quarantine while he was waiting for the test results. He decided to show up at the Senate Office, went to the gym, lunch, and events. Sinema and McSally both called his behavior extremely irresponsible.
