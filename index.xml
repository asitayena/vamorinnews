A studio pays the screenwriter for the rights to make that script into a film. Assuming the script actually gets green-lit, the studio spends millions of dollars producing it into an actual film. Whatever profits are generated at the box office, after theaters take a 40% cut, belong entirely to the studio. A superstar screenwriter will only make a couple hundred grand in TOTAL from this process, even from a movie that becomes a blockbuster smash.</description></item><item><title>How One Family Ended Up Owning The Largest Supply Of Oil In The World - And Earned TRILLIONS In The</title><link>/one-family-ended-owning-largest-supply-oil-world-earning-trillions-process.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/one-family-ended-owning-largest-supply-oil-world-earning-trillions-process.html</guid><description>A new Lamborghini and Range Rover in every driveway, pet tigers wearing diamond necklaces, $500 million private jets, oil gushing out of the ground with a slight pin prick, wiping your bottom with $100 bills.

There’s no sports information director in Indianapolis to redirect or bat away the press during media sessions, so what you hear from the prospects is usually a reflection of training and preparation (or lack thereof) by their inner circle.</description></item><item><title>Offset Fires Back At J.
