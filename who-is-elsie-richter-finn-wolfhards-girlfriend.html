Elsie has a younger brother named Ezra, who was born in 2005.</p><h2><strong>Elsie Richter is From a Family of Entertainers</strong></h2><p>Elsie Richter is from a family that has produced renowned actors, actresses, and writers. Her mother, Dolly Wells is an English actress and writer who began her career in 1997 and has been active in the entertainment industry since then till date.</p><p>As a writer, Dolly Wells has co-written several projects including Sky Living, Emily Mortimer, and Doll & Em. As an actress, she has starred in The Sea Change, I Capture the Castle, Black Mountain Poets, 45 Years, Pride and Prejudice, and Zombies, among others</p><p>Elsie’s maternal grandfather, John Wells is a renowned English satirist, actor, and writer. He is best known for featuring in movies like Gulliver’s Travels, Princess Caraboo, Consuming Passions, and Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.</p><p>Dolly Wells’ first cousin, Ann Chancellor (a distant relative of Elsie Richter) is an actress who is best known for featuring in movies like Stromboli, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris, Come Away, The Happy Prince, etc.</p><p>Another distant relative of Elsie Richter named Edward Chancellor is a British financial journalist and historian.</p><h2><strong>Elsie Richter’s Movies</strong></h2><p>Elsie Richter is following in the career footsteps of her mother, maternal grandfather, and other relatives. Between 2013 to 2015, she featured in Doll & Em, a TV series her mother co-wrote. Her younger brother, Ezra was also cast in Doll & Em; both siblings played the role of Emily’s children.</p><p>In 2019, Elsie Richter was featured in the short animated film, Di Bibl as a voice-over artist. Being a part of the production of Di Bibl gave Elsie the opportunity to work with renowned actors like Gabe Fazio and Brandon Lamar.</p><p>We cannot say for sure whether her family’s success in the entertainment industry has inspired Elsie to become an actress like them.</p><h2><strong>She Is Expected To Graduate From College</strong></h2><p>Although Elsie has started creating a name for herself in the entertainment industry, she has not left out the need to complete her tertiary education. According to reports, Elsie is a student at the University of Sussex, England, United Kingdom.</p><p>She became a freshman in 2020 and is expected to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in English Language and Literature in 2024. Elsie’s academic pursuit may be the reason why we have not seen her in movies after her voice-acting role in Di Bibl.</p><h2><strong>Elsie Richter and Finn Wolfhard Relationship</strong></h2><p>Elsie Richter is believed to be in a relationship with Finn Wolfhard. Finn is best known for featuring in notable productions like: Stranger Things, It, It: Chapter Two, and Ghostbusters: Afterlife.</p><p>He is also a musician.

Unfortunately, the public does not like that. According to Finn, some fans are great, while some can go as far as digging up private information about others. The Stranger Things actor said this because he was blackmailed into confirming his relationship status with Elsie Richter.</p><p>Accredited to him, a stranger insisted that if he does not publicly confirm his relationship with Elsie Richter, he/she was going to reveal Elsie’s address online to the public. As a result of this threat, Finn Wolfhard decided to share the now-deleted picture of himself and Elsie.</p><h3><strong>Elsie and Finn Wolfhard May No Longer Be Together</strong></h3><p>Since Finn Wolfhard deleted the picture of him and Elsie from his Instagram handle, he has not posted anything about them or his relationship online. Elsie, on the other hand, does not share information about her relationship status online.</p><p>Aside from the fact that neither of them is open about their relationship, they have not been spotted at events together like before. To cap it all up, Elsie Richter was not with Finn Wolfhard at the premiere of Stranger Things season 4 as Finn Wolfhard was seen alone on the red carpet. Their public absence from each other’s lives has made people suspect that they are no longer a couple.</p><h2><strong>Other Notable Facts About Elsie Richter</strong></h2><p>Elsie Richter is blonde and stands at a height of 5 feet 7 inches.
