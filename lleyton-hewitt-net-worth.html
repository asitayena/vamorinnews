By 2000, he became the youngest male player ever to have won the Grand Slam doubles title. He was just 19. At the U.S. Open in 2001, Hewitt won his first Grand Slam singles, beating the former number one Yevgeny Kafelnikov and defeating <a href=#><strong>Pete Sampras</strong></a> the following day.

In April 2021, his 12-year-old son Cruz Hewitt won the Australian junior tennis clay-court title in Canberra, clearly taking after his athletic father.</p><p>In 2008, in order to reduce the amount of tax he would have had to pay, Hewitt and his family relocated to their home in Nassau, Bahamas.</p><p>Hewitt's nickname is "Rusty," given to him by his tennis coach Darren Cahill, who thought that Hewitt resembled the character Rusty from the National Lampoon's Vacation series. Another nickname from fans includes "Rocky."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWkmruvtdJoo6Wdqam8r3nHnq6irKRiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lolita-star-sue-lyon-dead-73.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lolita star Sue Lyon dead at 73  WSOC TV">&larr;
