Husband And Net Worth</a></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who is Digga D?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rhys Angelo Emile Herbert, known professionally as Digga D, is a British rapper who rose to fame as a member of the UK drills collective 1011 in 2017.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He was born in West London on June 29, 2002, to a Jamaican mother and a Barbadian Father.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His interest in music began at 12 when he started listening to Jamaican reggae and dancehall and subsequently started writing music.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-994.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga D’ made his first song in 2011 at the Harrow Club with future 1011 associates M’Skum and Sav’O. His style incorporates elements of dancehall, bashment, and rap and draws influence from the British Caribbean community in West London.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Face considers him one of the pioneers of the UK drill scene, and GQ has called him “the most influential British rapper of our time.”</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happened To Digga D Eye?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2017, he and his group 1011 were arrested and given a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) in 2018.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The CBO required the group to have the Metropolitan Police’s permission before releasing any new music, forbade them from using London postcodes, and banned references to real-life incidents and people in lyrics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite these restrictions, Digga was recalled to prison in 2019 for breaching the conditions of his CBO. He was also stabbed in the eye with a blade fashioned from a tuna can, causing him to lose the use of the eye.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga D’s lawyer, Cecilia Goodwin, said the rapper struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-991.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In March 2020, Digga pleaded guilty to violent disorder and breaches of his CBO and was sentenced to two years and six months for his role in a machete brawl in front of shoppers in West London with rival gang members.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga was arrested again in July 2020 for inciting violence after attending a Black Lives Matter protest in London and posting about the movement on Instagram.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has since been released but is still under the conditions of his CBO. In November 2021, social media rumors claimed he was arrested for stabbing a man in Dubai. Still, Digga denied the allegations and said he was released soon after his arrest.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Why Was He Arrested?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Digga D is a prominent figure in Britain’s drill scene, a subgenre of hip-hop that portrays life in some of the country’s most deprived neighborhoods.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Digga D, a UK rapper, has been arrested multiple times for various charges. His sometimes-violent lyrics have drawn criticism from the Police and lawmakers who accuse the genre of fueling knife crime.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Like many of his peers, Digga D has found himself on the wrong side of the law, and his lyrics reflect his experiences of gang life, criminal justice, and time behind bars.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2018, Digga D was sentenced to 21 months for conspiracy to commit violent disorder. Upon his release in May 2020, he was given a court order banning him from rapping about violence.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The order was part of a criminal behavior order introduced in 2014, which gives judges broad powers to regulate a convicted criminal’s life, including the ability to control their lyrics.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-992.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The judge argued that Digga D’s lyrics, which often featured references to violence, could stoke street tensions and lead to further criminal activity. Since the ban was imposed, Digga D has been careful not to violate the order.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He has continued to make music but has focused on other topics, such as his experiences with mental health and the effects of the criminal justice system on young black men.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite the restrictions on his music, Digga D remains a popular figure in the drill scene, and his music resonates with many young people in Britain’s inner cities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While some argue that drill music glorifies violence and fuels criminal activity, others see it as a reflection of the harsh realities of life in Britain’s inner cities.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how authorities will balance the need to protect public safety with the right to artistic expression.</span></p><p><strong>You May Also Like: </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Malcolm X Autopsy Photos: Who Killed Him?
