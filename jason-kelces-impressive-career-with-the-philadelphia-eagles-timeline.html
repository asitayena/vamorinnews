Following the Eagles victory over the New England Patriots, Kelce delivered a passionate speech at the Eagles celebration parade while dressed up as a mummer – a musician who performs in the annual Philadelphia New Year’s parade.</p><p>“I’m going to take a second to talk to you about underdogs,” Kelce said to the crowd as he defended the Eagles coaching staff and players who were overlooked during their championship season. “<strong>Stefen Wisniewski</strong> wasn’t good enough, Jason Kelce is too small, <strong>Lane Johnson</strong> can’t lay off the juice, <strong>Brandon Brooks</strong> has anxiety, <strong>Carson Wentz</strong> didn’t go to a division one school, <strong>Nick Foles</strong> don’t got it … This entire organization with a bunch of driven men to accomplish something. We were a bunch of underdogs.”</p><p>Since that moment, Kelce has become a staple of the Eagles as he has broken franchise records and resigned multiple deals and extensions to stay in Philadelphia.</p><p>After that moment, Kelce became a staple of the Eagles as he broke franchise records and signed multiple deals and extensions to stay in Philadelphia until <a href=#>his retirement</a> was confirmed in March 2024.</p><p>Keep scrolling to take a look back on Kelce’s 13-year tenure with the Eagles:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Kelce-s-Impressive-Career-Timeline-With-the-Philadelphia-Eagles.jpg><h3>2011</h3><p>Kelce was selected by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. That same year, the NFL was in a lockout due to the owners and the National Football League Players Association not reaching an agreement for new contracts. While the draft took place in April 2011, the selected players were unable to sign their NFL contracts and practice with their respective teams until the strike was over in July 2011.</p><p>Once Kelce got his four-year contract situated, he joined the team’s practice squad and earned the role of starting center over <strong>Jamaal Jackson</strong>.</p><h3>2012</h3><p>After an impressive rookie year, Kelce returned to the field. However, his season was cut short in September after he tore his ACL and was out for the year.</p><h3>2013</h3><p>Kelce made a full recovery from his ACL tear and returned to the field with a vengeance. In the 2013 season, Kelce started in all his games and helped the Eagles make it to the playoffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Kelce-s-Impressive-Career-Timeline-With-the-Philadelphia-Eagles-2.jpg><h3>2014</h3><p>Following his breakout year, Kelce signed a six-year, $37.5 million contract extension with $13 million guaranteed. While he missed a few games that season to have surgery on a sports hernia, he was selected to play in his first Pro Bowl.</p><h3>2015</h3><p>Kelce had perfect attendance as he started in all 16 of his games that season. That same year, he also met his wife, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Kelce</strong></a>.</p><h3>2016</h3><p>The following year, Jason continued his streak of starting in all 16 games that season.</p><h3>2017</h3><p>All of Jason’s hard work finally paid off as 2017 was his best season on record and earned his first All-Pro honor. He was rated the highest-rated offensive lineman and won the award for Run Blocker of the Year. That season, the Eagles secured a spot in the playoffs and advanced to Super Bowl LII, which was played the following year, where they ultimately defeated the Patriots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Kelce-s-Impressive-Career-Timeline-With-the-Philadelphia-Eagles-3.jpg><h3>2018</h3><p>After reeling from Super Bowl LII, Jason made appearances at the Eagles’ Super Bowl parade and had a memorable cameo on It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He and Kylie also <a href=#>tied the knot</a> after three years of dating.</p><p>The following season, Jason earned his second All-Pro award.</p><h3>2019</h3><p>Jason extended his contract with the Eagles to 2021. That same year, he <a href=#>became a father</a> when he and Kylie welcomed daughter Wyatt in October 2019.</p><h3>2020</h3><p>The center reached a milestone as he started in his 100th career game. He was also a finalist for the Art Rooney Award which celebrates sportsmanship on the field.</p><h3>2021</h3><p>Jason signed a new deal with the Eagles for $12 million. He also was the Eagle’s finalist for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award. Kylie and Jason also expanded their family with daughter Eliotte in March 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Jason-Kelce-s-Impressive-Career-Timeline-With-the-Philadelphia-Eagles-4.jpg><h3>2022</h3><p>Ahead of the season, Jason <a href=#>contemplated retirement</a> but chose to stay with the Eagles another year. He signed a deal for $14 million which made him the highest-paid center in the NFL.</p><h3>2023</h3><p>Following the Eagles’ victorious 2022 season, they made it to Super Bowl LVII. Jason faced off <a href=#>against his brother</a>, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>, and the Kansas City Chiefs who ultimately <a href=#>won the championship</a>. Shortly after his Super Bowl appearance, Kylie gave birth to her and Jason’s third daughter Bennett.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jason considered retirement again but decided to stay for one more season and signed a one-year contract with the Eagles.</p><h3>2024</h3><p>The Eagles’ playoff journey came to an end in January 2024, as they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. While on the field, Jason <a href=#>looked emotional</a> following the defeat.&nbsp;While speculation swirled that Jason was going to hang up his pads following the game, he confirmed his decision in March 2024.</p><p>“So, this all brings us here to today. Where I announce that I am retiring from the NFL after 13 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles,” he announced in a press conference. “And today I must admit, I am officially overrated. Vastly overrated. It took a lot of hardwork and determination getting here. I have been the underdog my entire career, and I mean this when I say it, I wish I still was. Few things give me such joy as proving someone wrong.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGaq5%2Bjeqyxy5ycrGWZor2zsdKsoK%2BdXZius7HEq2SwoaSderW0xGanoaGclrGmuM%2BhoJpllZa0rbHSZquipZWhtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./115270-jerry-springer-net-worth-age-children-wife-education-show-movies-profiles.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jerry Springer's net worth, age, children, wife, education, show, movies, profiles">&larr;
