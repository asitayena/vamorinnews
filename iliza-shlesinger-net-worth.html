She also starred in, wrote, and produced "The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show" which premiered in April of 2020. She has stated that she has made an effort to develop a diverse writing team so that her comedy appeals to all genders and races, as she was sometimes pigeon-holed as a woman-only comic.</p><p>In January of 2021, the film "Pieces of a Woman" was released following its premiere at the 77th Venice International Film Festival. In the film, Shlesinger plays the character of Anita Weiss. She also starred in, wrote, and produced the romantic comedy film "Good on Paper" which premiered on Netflix in June of 2021.
