They were at <i>AT & T Stadium</i>, where Dustin dressed like a cowboy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/79741715_184257089296668_2010233443538659482_n%20(1)-1580206277332.jpg><p>Since then, she often uploads pictures of them on her Instagram, and Dustin also uploads pictures of them on his Instagram with sweet captions in it. For now, the couple seems to be happy and might be taking their relationship on to the next level as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Whereas, her parents also has a </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>extra-ordinary love life</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><h2>Still Remembers Late husband, Rob Bironas</h2><p>Rachel is currently <i>32</i> years old, and she is the widow of her late husband, <a href=#><strong>Rob Bironas</strong></a>. He was a professional American football placekicker and holds the NFL record for field goals in a single game (8), which was set during the match against Houston, Texas. The pair tied the knot on <i>28 June 2014</i> in front of their close friends and families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/47ab88f50d904ddd5001f5cb60e057ca%20(1)-1580206362986.jpg><p>The couple met in <i>2012</i> and started dating since then. Unfortunately, she lost her spouse the same year that they were married. Back in 2014, she posted on her Facebook,</p><p>"Two years ago, today, I met the most amazing man in the world. I married him and lost him shortly after."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/85ee5486a5a687e3b27229b918df7815%20(1)-1580206447706.jpg><p>Rachel added and told audiences to tell your loved ones, how much you love them every single day and don't hold grudges.</p><h2>What Happened To Rachel Bradshaw's Husband, Rob Bironas?</h2><p>Rob was found dead tragically after three months of their marriage, which was on <i>20 September 2014</i>, at around <i>11</i> pm. The cause of his death was blunt force trauma caused by the car crash. At that time, his blood-alcohol level was <i>0.218%</i>, and he lost control of his <i>2009 </i>Yukon Denali and crashed.</p><p>Before the incident happened, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bironas left the house at 10:30 pm</a>, saying her Goodnight, and she assumed that he was going to bed. However, she didn't find him on the couch and started searching and calling relatives. It was unusual behavior of him to leave like that, and she called the police.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/ByCus2EIAAAhPvl.jpg%20large%20(1)-1580206601241.jpg><p>She added, there were no fights and arguments between them, and he was not intoxicated when he was at home. After 15 minutes of his disappearance, a student at Belmont University called, saying that he threatened to kill him and his passengers.</p><p>Following the call from the student, a woman called <i>911 </i>and said Bironas tried to start a fight with her and her husband. Shortly after the call, he was found dead in the car crash.</p><h2>Wedding Ring As A Necklace</h2><p>Being a widow in a short period is very tragic and heartbreaking. Rachel has gone through the same unfortunate incident when she lost her partner, Rob Bironas, after marrying him for three months. On his memory and love, she got a tattoo on her wrist saying "Warrior" in November and announced on Facebook,</p><p>"That's what Rob stood for. He was a warrior and forever will be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/download-1580206504386.jpg><p>Not only that, but she has also made her wedding ring a unique symbol of love by turning it into a necklace and wearing it. She uploaded a picture of it on her Facebook back on <i>3 December 2014</i>.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>As a country singer, she might be earning a decent amount of money until now. The average income of a country singer is around <strong>$35,000</strong> as of<i> 2020</i>. So, she might be making about <strong>$40,000</strong> per year from her profession. Apart from her earnings and fortune, her late husband, Rob Bironas' net worth was about <strong>$12 Million</strong> at the time of his death.</p><p>As the couple does not share any children, she must have inherited all of his earnings and money. So, her net worth is around <strong>$12 Million</strong> as of now. Further, her father, Terry's<strong> </strong>luck, is approximately <strong>$20 Million</strong> as of now.</p><p><i><strong>Stay Updated With Us: </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jquYnKCVoXqjvsCdqqGZpw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-intern-review-anne-hathaway-robert-de-niros-comedy-is-lukewarm-2015239.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Intern Review: Anne Hathaway, Robert De Niro's Comedy Is Lukewarm">&larr;
